# CodechefScraper


Python code used to parse sample test cases of Codechef locally.This is primarily done to ease the running of sample test cases during Long Challenges/Short Challenges.

Running the file: Make sure the .cpp and the .py files are in the same directory including the source code.

Execution:

```python webcrawler.py```
(
    You will have to mention whether it is a challenge or not and specify the codes as asked.
    Next mention the name of your cpp file with .cpp extension.
)

Once the above has executed you just need to run the below command everytime you make any changes to your code.
It will automatically run your code with the example test cases and notify if all test cases have passed or where your code fails.

```./run.sh```

Good Luck!!
